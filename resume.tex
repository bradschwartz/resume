{\Large\textbf{Embark Trucks}} \hfill Remote; Nov. 2022 -- Mar. 2023

\textbf{Senior Software Engineer, Developer Experience}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Created ephemeral Jenkins agents on Kubernetes leveraging
            Terraform, Docker, and Jenkins plugins, and migrated a majority of jobs to these nodes
            for a predicted 30\% cost savings on compute and flexible scaling
      \item Migrated resources across Terraform Cloud Workspaces to team self-owned
            workspaces, allowing for faster development speed, impact, and allowing developers to take full ownership of their infrastructure
      \item Improved Jenkins reliability, stability, and performance by improving
            the configuration-as-code (Helm/Terraform), automating backups, and enforcing log rotation best practices

\textbf{Senior Software Engineer, Enterprise CICD}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Core contributor to internal Jenkins libraries, leading to a 20-30\% decrease in
        build times, more secure controls for production releases, and stronger
        integrations with AWS and enterprise systems
  \item Led the migrations of business-critical applications from customized Jenkins flows
        to standardized and resilient pipelines, enabling higher usage of reusable
        features and controls
%   \item Developed multiple tools and services that improved developer experience by
%         removing complexity and arbitrary-uniqueness while productionizing Docker-based microservice applications
  \item Maintainer of internal Homebrew tap, promoting easier production and distribution of develoment tools
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Engineer, Auto Loans Core Decisioning Platform}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Transitioned core auto finance decisioning engine from weekly batch
        process to real time API for declining delinquent credit card customers,
        leading to fewer data issues and decreasing unintended
        lending by 5\%
  \item Split 10 year old PL/SQL stored procedure into microservice based
        platform for sending explanatory letters when auto loans are not granted,
        resulting in fewer breakdowns, higher monitoring in the form of Splunk dashboarding,
        and fixing multi-year regulatory issue
%   \item Rebuilt internal web application for tracking auto loan applications,
%         integrating a Java back-end for pulling historical data from Snowflake
%         and displaying through an Angular 6 front-end
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Engineer, Risk and Regulatory Tech}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Overhauled cloud infrastructure, utilizing Jenkins pipelines and
        Docker-ized deployment tools to automate manual processes and allow for
        push-button deployment of code to Elastic MapReduce clusters and 25\% cost-savings
  \item Facilitated the migration of multiple data sources and sinks across AWS Virtual
        Private Clouds and enablement of HTTPS traffic, allowing for a single source
        of truth for regulatory data and tighter restrictions on data access
%   \item Heavily involved in Technology and Development groups, devoted to teaching
%         new technology and personally authored and led an 8-week learning series
%         to get employees AWS Solutions Architect Associate certified
