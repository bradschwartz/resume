        resulting in fewer breakdowns, higher monitoring in the form of Splunk dashboarding,
        and fixing multi-year regulatory issue
  \item Rebuilt internal web application for tracking auto loan applications,
        integrating a Java back-end for pulling historical data from Snowflake
        and displaying through an Angular 6 front-end
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Engineer, Risk and Regulatory Tech} \hfill Richmond, VA; Sept. '18 -- Sept. 2019
\begin{itemize}
  \item Overhauled cloud infrastructure, utilizing Jenkins pipelines and
        Docker-ized deployment tools to automate manual processes and allow for
        push-button deployment of code to Elastic MapReduce clusters and 25\% cost-savings
        % \item Built Python framework around modular Apache Spark application, integrating
        %       enterprise tools for secret management and data validation, reducing the
        %       deveopment lifecycle time
  \item Facilitated the migration of multiple data sources and sinks across AWS Virtual
        Private Clouds and enablement of HTTPS traffic, allowing for a single source
        of truth for regulatory data and tighter restrictions on data access
  \item Heavily involved in Technology and Development groups, devoted to teaching
